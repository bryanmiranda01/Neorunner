### Description <br />
Neorunner is a 2-D side scroller with a focus on fast-paced platforming and combat. The player
will explore a dystopian, cyberpunk city while fighting enemies, powering themselves up, and
stealing treasures across multiple levels

The gameplay loop of Neorunner is to infiltrate buildings, defeat enemies, and escape alive. The
player will navigate the level while clearing out enemies as they search for a specific objective.
Once the objective is acquired, they must make their way back out through the complex without
dying.
